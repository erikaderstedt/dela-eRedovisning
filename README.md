Nordea's eRedovisning service provides very nice bank statements in PDF format.
However, if you have two accounts and both accounts have activity on the same day, the
statements are downloaded into one big file.

This simple app splits and renames the bank statement into separate PDF files.
The renaming feature is useful even if you don't have separate accounts.

A Mac OS X binary (for version 10.10+) can be found here:
